# ðŸš€ API Gateway â€“ User Service

**API Gateway â€“ User Service** is a backend microservice written in **Go** with the **Fiber** framework.  
It follows the principles of **Clean Architecture**, where the application is divided into independent layers â€”  
`handler â†’ usecase â†’ repository â†’ storage` â€” ensuring maintainability, scalability, and easy extension.
